**Welcome to my Dog Classification app!** üê∂

This app uses a combination of AI systems, including an image classification model and a causal language model, to identify a dog's breed from an image and share a fun fact about it. With over 70 breeds currently supported, you can find the full list in the Dog_List.txt file. In this app I also have significantly automated the data collection and training processes. If you would like to see the LoRA adapter files, you can find them here in my Hugging Face [repository](https://huggingface.co/chrismontes/Dog-LoRA/tree/main).

Head over to the [QUICKSTART.md](https://github.com/chrismontes22/Dog-Classification/blob/main/QUICKSTART.md) to get the model running, or check out the rest of my GitHub repository to see the scripts that further streamlined the training process! üêï
