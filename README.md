Welcome to my Dog Classification app!

The purpose of this app is to use multiple AI systems, both an image classification model and a causal language model, to identify a dog's breed from an image and output a tidbit about the breed. There are over 70 breeds as of now, check out the Dog_List.txt for the full list! In this app I also have significantly automated the data collection and training processes.

Head over to the quickstart to get the model running, or check out the rest of my repository to see the scripts that helped me streamline the full training process.
